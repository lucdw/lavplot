Depends: R (>= 3.1.0), lavaan
Description: This package takes as input a sem model in lavaan syntax or the 
  resulting model description as a list or a data.frame. It can produce the necessary
  code to create a plot in tikz, in svg or in R using package diagram.
  The plot with diagram will be rather simple, but the plots in tikz and svg are
  meant to be incorporated in a pdf (tikz) or html (svg) file.
