Description: This package takes as input a sem model in lavaan syntax or the 
  resulting model description as a list or a data.frame or a fitted lavaan object.
  It can produce the necessary code to create a plot in tikz or in svg and can
  generate the plot in R, possibly saved to a PNG-file .
  The plots in tikz and svg are meant to be incorporated in a pdf (tikz) or html (svg) file.
